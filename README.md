# PREDICTIVE-MODEL
Built a Productive model to analyze and classify credit scores based on various financial and  demographic factors 

By systematically evaluating the performance of four machine learning models—K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest combined with R this project identified 
the best predictive model based on accuracy and feature importance
